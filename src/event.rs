//! Background work and the events it reports back.
//!
//! Everything that talks to the NAS runs off the main loop and reports through
//! one [`mpsc`] channel of [`AppEvent`]. The UI therefore never blocks on the
//! network: a poll that takes ten seconds, or fails outright, costs a frame of
//! staleness and a banner, never a frozen terminal.
//!
//! Two rules hold here:
//!
//! * **The poller is non-fatal.** A failed tick sends [`AppEvent::Error`] and
//!   the loop keeps ticking; the next successful tick clears the banner. A poll
//!   failure must never end the poller or the UI — a NAS that goes away for a
//!   minute is ordinary.
//! * **There is no `Tick` event.** The poller drives *data*; redraws are driven
//!   by whatever arrives, so an idle program with an idle NAS still redraws
//!   once per refresh interval and no more.
//!
//! Op tasks (delete in Task 15, pause/resume in Task 16) report through the
//! same channel as [`AppEvent::OpProgress`] / [`AppEvent::OpDone`], which is why
//! those variants exist before anything sends them.
